# Final Project: Part II

Using my sketches developed from last week, I further developed my story outline and relevant components visually through the use of a storyboard.  
My storyboards gives a visual walk-through of the primary elements of my updated outline, tying in my sketches where appropriate to illustrate how I intend to lead the reader through my experience.
