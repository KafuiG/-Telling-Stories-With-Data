## Step 1: find a data visualization (with data you can use!)
In 2015, the United Nations set universal (i.e., 100%) access to affordable, reliable and clean electricity by 2030 as Goal 7 of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, as of 2020, over 800 million people lack access to electricity, 600 million of which reside in sub-Saharan Africa. As such, efforts have been made to increase electricity access in the sub-continent. In light of this, utility companies and other stakeholders in the energy sector have sought to determine how demand for electricity will evolve in the coming years. Thus, I chose to visualize the Ethiopian Energy Authority's electricity demand projections to show the projected trend in demand over the coming years, per their estimates.
Here is the visualization below.

I had to create a data table from the visualization above because it was not provided.Here is the data table below.

## Step 2: critique the visualization
I will be critiquing this visualization based on the following criteria based on using Stephen Frew’s Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile.

**2.1	Usefulness** 
I think it gives a picture of total electricity sales over several years. However, the lack of distinction between the actuals and the forecasted sales does not make the forecasts clear. The high and low bars worst- and best-case scenario forecast but the legend title does not communicate this valuable information. It nonetheless shows a steady rise in electricity sales at the base case over the coming years. 

**2.2	Completeness** 
It has the basics needed to make it somewhat understandable. The legend does not entirely explain what the bars mean. High, low, and base might not communicate to an audience a forecast above the predicted base values or below the predicted base values. The title also does not spark discussion. Without looking at the title the audience should be able to quickly identify the unit of sales. Again, the legend details do not give a complete picture that the high and low bars are worst- and best-case scenarios of the base case.

**2.3	Perceptibility**
It takes some effort to identify the components of the chart. The positioning of the X and Y-axis titles would be best oriented horizontally. The numbers on the X-axis could also be easily readable by including commas after every third digit would also make it easy to read. Additionally, as I mentioned above a distinction between the actual and forecasted amounts would make visualization easier to understand. Wording the legend properly will proving more information about what each bar represents. Given that the visualization might be viewed by investors interested in Ethiopia’s power sector, I think it would be very important to make the distinction between the forecast and worst- and best-case scenarios.

**2.4 Truthfulness** 
I think the bars are a little misleading regarding showing the forecasts. A glance will not communicate this and the audience might be misled. The bars showing the high and low projections may also be mistaken for actual amounts and might insight comparison between bars. Perhaps using muted colors or grey might help.

**2.5	Intuitiveness** 
I had to read parts of the report to know what the legend represented. The units of sales were not immediately clear to me. It is not immediately clear what is being communicated even after reading the title. The color scheme also goes against the standards of green for good and red for bad. The visualization shows the opposite color scheme for its worst- and best-case scenarios.

**2.6	Aesthetics**
It is a simple visualization the grey horizontal lines behind the bar graph are not too distracting. However, I think reducing the width will improve the aesthetics. The color scheme could be improved by using a lighter shade for the forecast and switching the red with green and vis versa. The bars are almost too crowded perhaps using a chart that better shows a timeline would be more suitable for this visualization. The titles on the x ad y-axis could be better visualized horizontally. 

**2.7	Engagement**
This visualization although simple poses a lot more questions than insight. The title does not inspire the audience to talk about the data.

### **Follow up Questions**

**2.8 Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked well? What didn't? What, if anything, would you do differently?**

The first thing I observed was the colorful bars and legends. Generally, putting the three scenarios in the same chart (i.e., base, high and low) helped show the audience how demand grows in each scenario. However, I believe the use of bar charts did not properly communicate the trend in electricity demand over the years. I would use a line chart to do a better job of showing the trend.

**2.9	Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not?**
I believe the primary audience for this visualization are stakeholders in the Ethiopian energy sector, namely energy policymakers, electricity system planners, generation, transmission & distribution companies, energy researchers, and community end-users. I do not believe the visualization is effective for reaching such a diverse audience because firstly, it is not apparent in the visualization that a forecast is being made, the current form of visualization tends to suggest that the chart is showing collected data. Secondly, the use of bar charts makes it more challenging to see that demand is projected to grow significantly in Ethiopia. Lastly, a brief explanation of what the major takeaway is from the chart would help emphasize the point being made in the visualization.

**2.10	Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here? What would you change? Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)**
The method used to evaluate the data visualization here is adequate, in my opinion. It allows for a qualitative assessment of the visualization and the inclusion of detail for each metric of evaluation. However, the absence of quantitative metrics makes it challenging to give an overall rating of the visualization, and potentially compare it to other visualizations. Firstly, I recommend creating a scale of 1 to 5 to assess the visualization using each metric in addition to a detailed description of how the visualization performed in each category. Secondly, I would create a category to rate a visualization based on the diversity of audience it can reach (i.e., would people of varying demographics understand what is being communicated in the visualization?)


## Step 3: Wireframe a solution
**Initial Predesign Sketch**

I created an intial visualization in excel just visualize the data in a different way.

**Final Sketch**

I then sketched my visualization shown below to reflect the insights and problem areas I identified in the critique above.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98299182/152946266-01fffa48-ee62-4312-8b63-4f2d642947cf.JPG" width="700" height="700">

## Step 4: test the solution
I interviewed 4 people for feedback on my edesign above. I asked the following questions below and got these replies.

**Question 1. Can you tell me what you think this is?**
   - "Yes, I can it shows power demand in Ethiopia."
   - "Change in demand for energy over time with margins of error."
**Question 2. Can you describe to me what this is telling you?**
  - "It is showing me the forecasted electricity demand in Ethiopia for the next 30+ years. Demand will continue to grow rapidly in Ethiopia even in the worst-case scenario.
  - "Demand for energy is projected to increase between 2012 and 2052"
**Question 3.	Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?**
  - "No."
  - "The y axis isnt scaled, and the x axis appears discretized continuous. may be better represented using a histogram"
  - "Is there a model about the visualization that can be included."
**Question 4. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?**
  - "Energy policymakers, concerned/interested Ethiopians, energy researchers, etc."
  - "Someone interested in a report out of energy demand trends over time."
**Question 5. Is there anything you would change or do differently?**
  - "No"
  - "I'd represent this using a histogram"
**Question 6. What works in this visualization?**
  - "There is better distinction between the prediction and actual data values."
  - "The X and Y-axis better explain the visuals."
  - "The visualization section."
**Question 7. What does not work?**
  - "Its hard to connect the demand to year amounts."
  - "Change the color scheme."
  - "Try and emphasize the best and worst case scenarios as an area of projection."
  - "Include a description of the model."
  - "Change this to an area chart."
 
 **Reflection and takeaway**
I learned that people who were more familiar with energy research (i.e., experts) tended to understand the information being conveyed in the visualization very easily, and as a result, did not pay much attention to other details. Less informed audiences needed to rely on the details to understand the information being communicated in the chart. As such, these audiences made more helpful recommendations about improving the visualization than their expert counterparts. Taking this in to consideration _one_ sought to create avisualizations for a non-technical to understand.

## Step 5: build your solution
Using Flourish to I tried to visualize the data using different charts, including the ones suggested when I tested my solution. However, given flourishes limitations it was difficult to show the distinction between the actual and projected data. The projected line chart showed the best distinction. Because projected values in Flourish need to be shown in a different column it created a lot of redundant words when I created a legend. The other option was to visualize define the lines using titles directly following the lines as you see below. However, this caused the actual amounts to also be labelled. Considering these unfavorable options, I went with the label. Another issue that was raised in the critique of my redesign was the color scheme. In my final solution I used the https://coolors.co/palettes/trending website to generate a purple color palate. I went with varying shades of purple instead of the original colors because it gave information a neutral tone. Depending on the audience the best-case projection might not be favorable. For example, an energy investor the best-case scenario is more favorable because it presents an opportunity for profit.  However, the energy minister of Ethiopia might not see this as favorable if the country does not have enough supply to meet demand. I could not scale the y-axis as an interviewee suggested because this data was scrapped from the visuals. I also included a an engaging title and subtitle to give more information to the audience without crowding the visuals. Lastly, the y-axis title was changed and positioned in a more readable orientation. While the x-axis did not need a title because it clear shows that it captures the years. The orientation for this was also changed slightly to improve readability.
