## Step 1: find a data visualization (with data you can use!)

## Step 2: critique the visualization
**1.	Usefulness** Is it useful for the intended audience? Does it communicate valuable information?
I think it gives a picture of total electricity sales over several years. However, the lack of distinction between the actuals and the forecasted sales does not make the forecasts clear. The high and low bars worst- and best-case scenario forecast but the legend title does not communicate this valuable information. It nonetheless shows a steady rise of electricity sales at the base case over the coming years. 
** 2.	Completeness ** Does the visualization have everything necessary to make it understandable?
It has the basics needed to make it somewhat understandable. The legend does not entirely explain what the bars mean. High, low, and base might not communicate to an audience a forecast above the predicted base values or below the predicted base values. The title also does not spark discussion. Without looking at the title the audience should be able to quickly identify the unit of sales. Again the legend details does not give a complete picture that the high and low bars are worst- and best-case scenarios of the base case.
3.	Perceptibility. Can the reader understand the information with minimal effort? Is the visualization type appropriate? Does it use illogical comparisons?
It takes effort to identify the components of the chart. The positioning of the X and Y-axis titles would be best oriented horizontally. The numbers on the X-axis could also be easily readable by including commas after every third digit would also make it easy to read. Additionally, as I mentioned above a distinction between the actual and forecasted amounts would make visualization easier to understand. Wording the legend properly will proving more information about what each bar represents. Given that the visualization might be viewed by investors interested in Ethiopiaâ€™s power sector, I think it would be very important to make the distinction of the forecast and worst- and best-case scenarios.
4.	Truthfulness. Is the visualization accurate, reliable, and valid? Is it representing what it says it is, and in the most complete and truthful manner? Does it misrepresent the data or make comparisons that aren't correct?
I think the bars are a little misleading regarding showing the forecasts. A quick glance will not communicate this and the audience might be misled. The bars showing the high and low projections may also be mistaken for actual amounts and might insight comparison between bars. Perhaps using muted colors or grey might help.
5.	Intuitiveness. Is it easy to understand and clearly communicates the information? If unfamiliar, does it include easy to understand instructions on how to interpret it?
I had to read parts of the report to know what the legend represented. The units of sales were not immediately clear to me. It is not immediately clear what is being communicated even after reading the title. The color scheme also goes against the standards of green for good and red for bad. The visualization shows the opposite color scheme for its worst- and best-case scenarios.
6.	Aesthetics. It is interesting / enjoyable to look at? Is it a good example of what a beautiful data visualization might look like? Is it somewhere in the middle - pleasing but otherwise not distracting to look at?
It is a simple visualization the grey horizontal lines behind the bar graph are not too distracting. However, I think reducing the width will improve the aesthetics. The color scheme could be improved by using a lighter shade for forecast and switching the red with green and vis versa. The bars are almost too crowded perhaps using a chart that better shows a timeline would be more suitable for this visualization. The titles on the x ad y axis could be better visualized horizontally. 
7.	Engagement. Does it lead the audience to learn more about the topic? Does it inspire the audience to talk about the data or share it with others?
This visualization although simple poses a lot more questions than insight. The title does not inspire the audience to talk about the data.
8.	Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked really well? What didn't? What, if anything, would you do differently? *
The first thing I observed were the colorful bars and legend. Generally, putting the three scenarios in the same chart (i.e., base, high and low) was helpful in showing the audience how demand grows in each scenario. However, I believe the use of bar charts did not properly communicate the trend in electricity demand over the years. I would use a line chart to do a better job of showing the trend. 
9.	Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not? *
I believe the primary audience for this visualization are stakeholders in the Ethiopian energy sector, namely energy policy makers, electricity system planners, generation, transmission & distribution companies, energy researchers and community end-users. I do not believe the visualization is effective for reaching such a diverse audience because firstly, it is not apparent in the visualization that a forecast is being made, the current form of visualization tends to suggest that the chart is showing collected data. Secondly, the use of bar charts makes it more challenging to see that demand is projected to grow significantly in Ethiopia. Lastly, a brief explanation of what the major takeaway is from the chart would help emphasize the point being made in the visualization.
10.	Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here? What would you change? Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.) *
The method used to evaluate the data visualization here is adequate, in my opinion. It allows for a qualitative assessment of the visualization and inclusion of detail for each metric of evaluation. However, the absence of quantitative metrics makes it challenging to give an overall rating of the visualization, and potentially compare it to other visualizations. Firstly, I recommend creating a scale of 1 to 5 to assess the visualization using each metric in addition to a detailed description of how the visualization performed in each category. Secondly, I would create a category to rate a visualization based on the diversity of audience it can reach (i.e., would people of varying demographics understand what is being communicated in the visualization?)
11.	Can you tell me what you think this is?
Yes
12.	- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
It is showing me the forecasted electricity demand in Ethiopia for the next 30+ years. Demand will continue to grow rapidly in Ethiopia even in the worst-case scenario.
13.	- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
No.
14.	- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Energy policy makers, concerned/interested Ethiopians, energy researchers, etc.
15.	- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
No
