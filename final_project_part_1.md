# Final Project: Part 1
## Project Overview
This project is to meant to shed light on the growing concern of college students mental health in the United States. It is interesting to note that studies have shown that student mental health has worsening even before the pandemic. I want to highlight the impact on students, the school and possible the country. Provide a breakdown of potential cause of mental health stressers. 

## Project Outline
Here's an overview of the major elements of my story:
	- Overall overview of mental health of US uni students
         -- maybe add the impacts that negative metal health in US schools has had on people + maybe the country (Google Scholar research studies +news articles may be helpful)
	- Case study on 2/3 schools with poor mental health (Georgia Tech, University of Pennsylvana, CMU)
	- One case study on a school with positive mental health
	- Recommendations of what schools need to do: invest in expanding counseling centers, regular evaluation of hired psychologists in counseling center, student evaluation of counseling center every semester, etc.
	- Call to action: Impacts that positive mental health can have on American society/economic growth, etcâ€¦.this can be like some 2-3 dramatic sentences.

## Initial Sketches

## Data Sources

## Method and Medium

### Method
I plan on creating intitial visualizations of my sketches above, using Flourish. To accomplish this goal, there are some additional data cleaning steps that I need to complete, such as getting all of the years of endowment data into one .csv file. I also want to start incorporating and embedding some of these initial visualizations into Shorthand to start to see how the story that I am trying to communicate is coming togehter. Then, I will spend next week starting some user research and making tweaks to my final website, as needed. Finally, I will use some of the key points in my story arc sketch to begin developing my 1-minute presentation that will occur in 2 weeks.

### Medium

I plan on completing the my final project using Shorthand. I will probably make some visuals using Flourish and others using Tableau. I intend to use FLoursh mainly, since I am better at using it. However, I'll use Tableau if I find that Flourish is limiting in terms of design options. I will use Shorthand to pull together text and my visualizations into a coherent story.
