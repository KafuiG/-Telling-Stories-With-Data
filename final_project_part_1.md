# Final Project: Part 1
## Project Overview
This project is to meant to shed light on the growing concern of college students mental health in the United States. It is interesting to note that studies have shown that student mental health has worsening even before the pandemic. I want to highlight the impact on students, the school and possible the country. Provide a breakdown of potential cause of mental health stressers. 

## Project Outline
### Story Arc
The image below shows the emotional journey I expect the audience to experience. The smiley faces represent the highs and lows.

### Here's an overview of the major elements:
- Overall overview of mental health of US universities students.
- Specifically highlight which aspects of mental health need more urgent attention (i.e., depression and anxiety) based on statistics.
- Impact that negative metal health in US schools has had on people and maybe the country (Google Scholar research studies + news articles may be helpful)
- Covid -19 effect on mental health: a case study of students in Texas A&M
- Case study on 2/3 schools with poor mental health: Georgia Tech and University of Pennsylvana
- Recommendations of what schools need to do: invest in expanding counseling centers, regular evaluation of hired psychologists in counseling center, student evaluation of counseling center every semester, etc.
- Call to action: Impacts that positive mental health can have on American society/economic growth, etcâ€¦.based on Georgia Tech's mental health task force reports.

## Data Sources
1. I will use data from [ACHA](https://www.acha.org/NCHA/ACHA-NCHA_Data/Publications_and_Reports/NCHA/Data/Reports_ACHA-NCHAIIc.aspx) to compare mental health finfding between 2019 and 2015.
2. I will also use information from [The Healthy Minds Study](https://healthymindsnetwork.org/data/) to show or compare symptoms and what students are curently dealing with. I have requested for the data from The site and should be recieving it shortly.
3. I will also talk about the major concerns troubled students present from [AUCCCD](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aucccd.org%2Fassets%2Fdocuments%2FSurvey%2F2019-2020%2520Annual%2520Report%2520FINAL%2520March-2021.pdf&clen=1857432&chunk=true)
4. Furthermore, I have identified reports from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/pathforward/gt-student-mental-health-report.pdf) and [University of Pennsylvania](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&context=anthro_seniortheses) that can be used as case studies regarding poor mental health in US schools. Additionally, I will be using [a dataset of mental health statistics of students in Texas A&M University](https://www.jmir.org/2020/9/e22817/) to highlight the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in US Schools.


## Method and Medium
### Method
I plan on creating intitial visualizations of my sketches above, using Flourish. To accomplish this goal, there are some additional data cleaning steps that I need to complete, such as getting all of the years mentel health data into an excel document. Next week, I will start imbedded the initial visualizations into Shorthand to see how the story is coming togehter. Then, I will spend next week starting some user research and making tweaks to my final website, as needed. Finally, I will use some of the key points in my story arc sketch to begin developing my 1-minute presentation that will occur in 2 weeks.

### Medium

I plan on completing the my final project using Shorthand. I will probably make some visuals using [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) and others using Tableau. I intend to use FLoursh mainly, since I am better at using it. However, I'll use [Tableau](https://shorthand.com/) if I find that Flourish is limiting in terms of design options. I will use Shorthand to pull together text and my visualizations into a coherent story.
