# Final Project: Part III
## Final project overview
My final project shows the impact of Covid-19 on mental health in US colleges. Starting with some background I give some statistics that show that in the years leading into the pandemic, mental health incidents were already increasing rapidly in US colleges. Most importantly for administrators, I show that poor mental health reduces productivity by 50% in US colleges, which should be a major concern for school administrators. Then, I look at the impact of COVID-19 and show the leading causes of mental stress among students. In conclusion, I recommend increased investment in counseling centers, periodic evaluation of mental health resources and setting up student-led and student-appointed task forces to school administrators.

## Part I
During the first phase of the project, I focused on developing the arc of my data story about mental health in the United States. I gathered data from various sources and made the decision to focus on the state of mental health in US colleges. I also ideated the data visualizations that would be necessary to make the story compelling to its intended audience (i.e., school administrators and officials).
I used OneNote to make my story arc and initial sketches of my data visualizations.

## Part II
For the second phase of the project, I fleshed out my story using Shorthand to make the story as coherent as possible. I then used existing, cited visualizations as placeholders to get feedback from people in academia (representing school administrators) about the coherence of the story and adequacy of data.
After this, I defined the audience for the project, established the approach to identifying representative individuals to interview and designed the interview questions. Once this user research protocol was in place, I shortlisted the interviewees so that they closely resemble the intended audience. 
Using the survey responses, I chose to make significant changes to my data visualization for Part III, as well as narrow the scope of my story to focus on the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in US colleges.

## Part III: Explained in terms of changes from Part II
In the third phase of this project, I implemented feedback from the survey respondents in Phase II. I have divided this section into the main categories of changes made in this phase.

### Narrowing down the scope
After discussion with one of my survey respondents and the professor, I chose to narrow the scope of my story to focus on the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in US colleges.
This focus provided me with perspective on what type of data needed to be visualized to tell a compelling story about why addressing mental health should be a priority in US universities.

### Audience
The intended audience for my project is school administrators and officials. With the already deplorable state of mental health on college campuses prior to the pandemic, school officials need to realize that mental illness causes a 50% reduction in productivity. Furthermore, the increasing rate of suicide attempts is an alarming statistic that compels them into action.

### Data Visualizations and Recommendations
The main changes that I made to the data visualizations:
- Added a consistent color scheme to align with the "dark theme" of depression and anxiety
- Included new data from recent studies showing the impact of the pandemic on mental health on these campuses
- Included a resource guideline link for school administrators to use if they would like to address mental health on campuses 
- Found new statistics about the causes of increased mental illness due to the pandemic.
- Added navigation topics to help guide the reader

With regards to the first main change, I used the "mood board" theme in Shorthand as my design approach to capture the sombre nature of depression and anxiety.
The second change resulted from narrowing the focus of my topic to the impact of the pandemic on mental health in US colleges. I also included infographics in the background section to reduce the amount of text the audience had to peruse to garner the necessary information. 

## Post-Presentation Thoughts & Remarks
After my presentation, I made the small change of adding spaces to my transitions and reformatting some of my text. I also created the write-up document for submission.
From this data story creation process, I realized how instrumental getting feedback from a somewhat representative sample of your target audience is to telling a compelling story using data. Secondly, the process of narrowing down the scope of my story made me understand the importance of making a concise point that captures the attention of your audience. Prior to this project, I would often begin writeups with a very generic big-picture of the problem before focusing in on the topic at hand. Furthermore, I also learned that surveys need to be issued with the survey creator present while the respondent takes the survey to ensure that responses are thorough enough to be useful for feedback. Lastly, this course was the perfect combination of my interest in solving problems with large datasets and my passion for visual arts -- it was very fulfilling to exercise my creativity in the space of data analytics.
