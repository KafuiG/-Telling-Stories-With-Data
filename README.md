# About me

Hello there! My name is Kafui Godzi. I use she/her/hers pronouns. Iâ€™m a second-year masters student in Public Policy & Management at Carnegie Mellon University. Originally from Ghana, my undergraduate degree was in Business Administration Accounting. Cumulatively, I have two years of work experience primarily in the energy industry. Specifically, I worked as an analyst for the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) as part of my national service. Over the years, my passion for problem-solving has largely informed the activities I invest my time in. From assisting a women-focused nonprofit with graphic designing to consulting for small-medium enterprises in Ghana, I always seek opportunities to make meaningful impact in any community I find myself in. Outside of my professional life, I thoroughly enjoy catching up on the latest fashion, occasionally sketching out clothing designs and learning about new developments in dermatology.

# What I hope to learn
My coursework in the Public Policy & Management program here has provided me with a wide variety of data analytics skills, such as programming, database management and geospatial network analysis among others. As such, I hope that this course will provide me with the skills to succinctly and persuasively communicate ideas, which stem from processing large datasets, to a general audience.
