# **Week 2: Visualizing Government Debt**
A number of web-based tools allow data visualizations to be created directly and then embeded separately, so the first part of this assignment will involve taking the code for the generated visualization I have customized and placing it in my portfolio page. 
The data set used for part one and two are government debt to GDP ratio sourced from the OECD website. It explains the general government debt-to-GDP ratio as a measure of the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.


## **Working with web-based visualization tools and data**

### Part 1: Working with OECD
#### 1.1  Bar chart 
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) gives access to free downloadable datasets and a tool to allow data visualization to be customized and embed directly from their website.
This plot shows the general government's debt-to-GDP ratio for the year 2020 for Turkey, Romania and the united states.

### Part 2: Working with Flourish
Flourish allows one even more custimization. The data set from OECD has has been visualized using Grid of lines chart to make it easier to visualize the GDP debt ratio easily across a number of countries and years.
