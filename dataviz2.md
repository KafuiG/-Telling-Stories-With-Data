# **Week 2: Visualizing Government Debt**
A number of web-based tools allow data visualizations to be created directly and then embeded separately, so the first part of this assignment will involve taking the code for the generated visualization I have customized and placing it in my portfolio page. 
The data set used for part one and two are government debt to GDP ratio sourced from the OECD website. It explains the general government debt-to-GDP ratio as a measure of the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.


## **Working with web-based visualization tools and data**

### Part 1: Working with OECD
#### 1.1  Bar chart 
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) gives access to free downloadable datasets and a tool to allow data visualization to be customized and embed directly from their website.
This plot shows the general government's debt-to-GDP ratio for the year 2020 for Turkey, Romania and the united states.

### Part 2: Working with Flourish
Flourish allows one even more custimization. The data set from OECD has has been visualized using Grid of lines chart to make it easier to visualize the GDP debt ratio easily across a number of countries and years. 
#### 2.1 Grid of line charts

The data visualized in Part 2 shows the debt-to-GDP ratio of OECD countries. Essentially, the debt-to-GDP ratio is a measure of how much a country may have had to "borrow" in a given year compared to its GDP which represents its economic productivity. Hence, this visualizaition provides a snapshot of the state of the economies of these select developed countries. The data was pulled from the OECD dataset on government debt.

The government debt bar chart is the best of the three visualization in making comparisons between countries for a given year (i.e., 2020). An audience can easily see which countries have the largest and lowest debts in 2020. However, a series of bar charts for each year would not have the same effect as the line chart in 2.2. This is because if a series of bar charts were used, it would be more difficult for an audience to infer the trend in debt-to-GDP ratio for a given country since they would have to look through each chart for the same country to infer its debt ratio. On the other hand, while the line chart shows the trend in debt ratio over the years, and makes it immediately visible to the audience, it is more difficult for an audience to infer upon first glance which countries have the highest and lowest debt ratios.

Although the line chart shows the nominal debt-to-GDP ratio (i.e., the magnitude in percent), the area chart does a better job of showing the enormity (or size) of that debt. The line chart is better in showing the trend in debt-to-GDP ratio over the years since an audience is immediately drawn to the pattern upon first glance. However, the area chart alerts the audience to the magnitude of that debt over the years. As such, an audience can infer not only the trend in the ratio over the years, but also the magnitude of it upon first glance.
