# Final Project: Part II

Using my sketches developed from last week, I further developed my story outline and relevant components visually through the use of a [storyboard](https://preview.shorthand.com/DcEyCmJFuJEdhxcK).  
My storyboards gives a visual walk-through of the primary elements of my updated outline, tying in my sketches where appropriate to illustrate how I intend to lead the reader through my experience.


## Target Audience
The target audience for my presentation is US university administration officials, and stakeholders in the college system.
## Approach to Identifying Interviewees
My user research protocol describes what you hope to find during my user interviews, including my research questions and the script. Since my project aims to address the state of mental health in US colleges, and recommendations for solutions to these mental health issues, my intended audience is university administration officials. However, due to my inability to interview such high-ranking officials, I interviewed three people in academia (i.e., doctorate students), two of whom are recent university graduates.

## Interview Script
The following questions were asked of the three survey respondents using the following Google Form: https://forms.gle/V22tzQ5zB7DyVw6a9 
1.	Based on the visuals you just observed, who do you think is the target audience for this presentation?
2.	Were there any parts that were confusing? If so, which parts?
3.	What aspects of the presentation did you find most compelling and informative?
4.	Were there any missing pieces of information you felt should be added to the presentation?
5.	Were there any parts of the presentation you felt were distracting or unnecessary?
6.	Do you believe there is adequate data and information in the presentation to support the main topic/argument being made?
7.	What is/are your main takeaway(s) from the presentation?
8.	Any final thoughts, comments, or suggestions?

## Interview Findings
Generally, the survey respondents found the presentation to be quite compelling. Each respondent felt they learned a substantial amount about mental health in US colleges, and the recommended call to action for university administration officials.
## Changes to be Implemented in Part III
 1. I intend on doing a second round of surveys for a draft of the final presentation, and implementing the feedback accordingly.
 2. The call to action and recommendation sections would need to be fully fleshed out with citations.
 3. I will consider changing the visualizations in Shorthand per the feedback from my survey respondents.
